                <h3><strong>Study of Leader-Member Exchange and the Effect of Deaf Identity on Relationship Quality</strong></h3>
                <p>June 6, 2016</p>
                <p>You are being invited to participate in a research study about Deaf identity and its effect on leadership preference in the Deaf Community.  The objective of this research project is to attempt to understand if a person’s Deaf identity plays a role in the leader-follower relationship involving people who are Deaf or hard of hearing.   It is being conducted across the United States via the internet.</p>
                <p>There are no known risks if you decide to participate in this research study, nor are there any costs for participating in the study.  The information you provide will help me understand how best to address employer and Deaf employee relationships, as well as, how to satisfy the needs of companies and the needs of Deaf employees. The information collected may not benefit you directly, but what I learn from this study should provide general benefits to employees, companies, and researchers.</p>
                <p>This survey is anonymous. If you choose to participate, you do not have to provide your name.  No one will be able to identify you, nor will anyone be able to determine which company you work for.  No one will know whether you participated in this study.
